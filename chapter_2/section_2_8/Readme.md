### Exercise 2-11.

The non-recursive version appears a bit faster. On the machine used, for a 30-million-node tree, the non-recursive version takes about 2 microseconds to find an element, while the recursive version takes about 5 microseconds. 

(A larger example tree would give a more definite answer, but it's expensive to generate using the insert method.)
